Hey!

This is a project that I've been wanting to make for some time. It's basically a python program that allows the user to graph functions right in the console. This program is inferior to tools like Desmos and Geogebra, but the challenge of graphing in the console was very fun.

The program first prompts the user to set up their screen. The program enlists the user's help to figure out the console's size and to figure out the ratio of the font used in the console. 

The user is free to add as many functions as they want, and can use different colours to graph them. 

The user is allowed to use the following operations and functions: +, -, *, /, ^, root, sin, cos, tan, sqrt, cbrt, arctan, arcsin, arccos, abs
The use of parentheses is suggested for clarity in ambigious situations.

The keyboard module, which can be found at https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/, is used and required for the program to work.
